## General Information
The aim of the project is to create an application for searching, communicating and hiring professionals.
In the application we can distinguish two types of accounts, the User account and the Contractor account.
The main goals of the application from the User's perspective is to provide them with a clear and easy to use interface
for searching and communicating with contractors. Private users are provided with tools allowing them to search
and filter the system in order to find the right professionals for them. On the Contractor side,
the application will allow you to present your business to a wider audience and help in organizing your work.
Each contractor's profile will serve as a page that advertises his company and its services.
